The company has a hierarchical structure, that is, the supervisor relation forms
a tree rooted at the president. The personnel office has ranked each employee with
with a convivality rating, which is a real number. In order to make the party fun
for all attendees, the president does not want both an employee and his or her immediate
supervisor to attend. Implement an algorithm to make up a guest list that maximizes the sum
of the conviviality ratings of the guests.
